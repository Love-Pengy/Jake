# dotfiles

- My dotfiles for my current setup!

**NOTE:** I am not responsible for you messing up your system with the install script. As you've heard already don't run other peoples stuff on your machine without knowing what it does

to run install use: ``` sudo -H -s ./install.sh ```
- to understand what this command does refer to man sudoers
